This project is a web-based Event Organizer System developed to help visitors find and book events easily.  
First, the system presents different event categories such as Business, Social, Education, Entertainment, Sports, and Travel.  
Next, users can browse events under each selected category and view detailed information about them.  
After reviewing the details, visitors can book the event through a simple and straightforward process.  
The system provides confirmation of the booking and ensures easy navigation throughout the platform.  
contribution includes designing the system structure, defining the scope, organizing event categories, and implementing the complete frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
